# Flåklypa Grand Prix (PC, 2000-2002) - engine notes

Status: initial investigation. Detection works for the Norwegian Gold edition
(Gullutgave, v1.2, 2 CDs). The engine opens the `DATA` containers and shows the
main menu backdrop; no game logic exists yet.

## The game

* Developer: Capricornus Computer Game Productions AS (Caprino Video Games),
  Norway. Editions: original (2000), Jubileumsutgave (2001), Gullutgave (2002).
  Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and English text exists in the language packs.
* Custom C++ engine. Win32, DirectDraw (`ddraw.dll`), DirectSound, WinMM,
  RAD Smacker (`smackw32.dll`), IJG libjpeg (used only by the 3D-glasses
  "anaglyph" add-on and screenshots). No scripting language: all scene and
  mini game logic is compiled into `FGP.exe` (about 1.1 MB unpacked).
* Screen: 800x600, 24-bit backdrops, 8-bit RLE hotspot masks.
* The retail disc uses Link Data Security (CD-Cops) copy protection
  (`CDCODE.KEY`, `FGP.W_X`, `FGP.QZ_`). This has no bearing on the data files.
* Configuration is stored in the registry under
  `HKLM\SOFTWARE\CapricornuS AS\Flåklypa Grand Prix\1.00.000`
  (`Data Path`, `Language`, `Layouts`, `Profiles`, `ScreenShot`, `Windowed`,
  `Debug Log`, ...).

## Install layout

The CDs are plain ISO 9660 (the archived `.mdf` images are raw 2448-byte
sectors, Mode 1: strip 16 bytes of sync/header and 384 bytes of EDC/ECC/sub-
channel per sector to get a mountable ISO).

```
<install>/bin/FGP.exe
<install>/data/<scene>.bin      48 containers, main game (all languages)
<install>/lang/<scene>.bin      48 containers, Norwegian text, fonts, dubbed clips
<install>/data1/<scene>.bin     CD1: add-on set 1 (subtitles, extra fonts, hopscotch...)
<install>/data2/<scene>.bin     CD1: add-on set 2 (balloonhunt, colorfill, mahjong, puzzle,
                                textinvader, whackamole, 2 extra race tracks)
<install>/data3/<scene>.bin     CD2: add-on set 3 (anaglyph 3D, gametrivia, mathlab, synonym)
<install>/lang1..3/<scene>.bin  CD2: language packs for the add-on sets
<install>/data/fence/tunes/*.tun  loose files (music editor tunes)
```

Each container holds one *scene*: a story page (`yard`, `desk`, `house`, ...),
a sub game (`beemaze`, `bugzzz`, `chess`, ...), an activity, or a shared pool
(`common`). `data/sceneindex.bin` + `scene.ini` list the story pages and games
and which cursor to show for each.

## `DATA` container format

See `archive.h`. 12-byte header (`"DATA"`, u32 version = 0x100, u32 count),
followed by `count` entries of `char name[260]` (uninitialised bytes after the
NUL), `u32 size`, `byte data[size]`. No index, no compression. Names use
backslashes and are relative to the scene (`animation\idle.smk`).

Totals for the Gold edition: 6264 files, about 1 GB uncompressed.

| Type | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `.smk` | 1735 | Smacker SMK2/SMK4. Animations, cursors, music (`common/music/*.smk`), speech. 425 are 4x4 "audio only" clips. |
| `.bmp` | 3682 | 24-bit backdrops/buttons, 8-bit RLE `hotspots.bmp` masks, 8-bit fonts (`common/fonts/*.bmp`), race tracks (2000x1600 8-bit). |
| `.wav` | 516 | PCM 16-bit mono 22050/44100 Hz (`fence` music editor, `bugzzz`, racing). |
| `.ini` | 244 | Windows INI. `sound.ini` volumes, `help.ini` help text, `track.ini` / `car.ini` / `stage*.ini` race parameters, `scene.ini` scene index, `language.ini` all UI strings, `subtitle/*.ini` subtitles. |
| `.pfl` | 10 | Player profiles (save games). |
| `.tun` | 20 | Tunes for the `fence` music editor. |
| `.nod`, `.ai`, `.l`, `.map`, `.eff`, `.fff` | few | Binary race track collision/path data and `mountain`/`balloonhunt` level maps. Not yet analysed. |

INI files are Windows-1252. The executable also reads `*.lst` files (not found
in the data; probably runtime generated).

## How a scene works (from `FGP.exe` strings)

* `%s/%s/backdrop.bmp`, `%s/%s/hotspots.bmp`: static scene art and hotspot
  mask. Mask index 0 = nothing, 1..99 = animation hotspots, 100+ = other kinds
  (sub game entry, fact, music...). The mapping from index to action is in
  the executable, per scene.
* `%s/%s/animation/%s.smk` and `%s-o.smk` (overlay variant), `%s/%s/sound/%s.wav`,
  `%s/common/cursors/%s.smk`, `%s/common/fonts/%s.bmp`, `%s/common/music/%s.smk`,
  `%s/common/profiles/%s.pfl`, `%s/common/dialogue/<dlg>/...` for dialog boxes
  (`msgbox`, `awarddlg`, `highscore`, `navigate`, `calendar`, `roster`, ...).
* Modules seen in the binary: DRAW, WINDRAW, SOUND, PLAYER (Smacker playback),
  SCENE, TITLE, GAME, EVENT, RACE, CAR, TRACK, PATH, SCORE, HISCORE, AWARD,
  PROFILE, CONFIG, TIP, DESC, ACTIVITY, PRINT, JOY, BEEMAZE (C++ class).
* Racing is a 2-D top-down game: 2000x1600 track bitmap, `terrain.bmp` for
  surface types, `map.bmp` mini map, `path.ai` AI waypoints, `collision.nod`.
  `car.ini` has accel/grip/mass and AI bias values.

## Plan

1. Scene framework: load backdrop + hotspot mask, cursor Smacker, play
   Smacker animations at hotspot positions (ScummVM has `Video::SmackerDecoder`).
2. Language strings from `lang/common.bin:language.ini` via `Common::INIFile`.
3. Menu, scene index, story page navigation, `help.ini` dialogs.
4. Sub games one by one (each is a small hard-coded game).
5. Racing game (2-D).
6. Profiles (`.pfl`) as save games.

Reverse engineering of per-scene hotspot behaviour needs disassembly of
`FGP.exe` (the Gold v1.2 update replaces it, so work from the updated one).
